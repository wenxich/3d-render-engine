# 3D Render Engine (Java)
A 3D render engine created using Java Swing.

I decided to take on this challenge to learn more about Java Swing (and Java in general) since <a href="https://github.com/wenxich/snake">my Snake project</a>.

This 3D render engine is still a work-in-progress. Currently, users are able to play around with a simple transparent (except for the edges) tetrahedron.

**Future updates:**
- coloring the tetrahedron
- incorporating simple lighting/shading on the tetrahedron
- adding a feature for users to adjust the colors on the tetrahedron
