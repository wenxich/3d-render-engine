# 3D Render Engine (Java)

I took on this challenge to learn more about Java Swing (and Java in general) since <a href="https://github.com/wenxich/snake">my Snake project</a>.

## Features:
- **Horizontal and vertical rotation:** users can use sliders to rotate the 3D object.
- **RGB color selection:** users can use sliders to adjust the color of the 3D object.
- **Sphere approximation:** users can use a slider to "inflate" the initial tetrahedron to create a sphere approximation.
